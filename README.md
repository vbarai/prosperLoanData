# Summary 
My visualization is for a loan data. There are 2 graphs, one shows the loan distribution among a different state with respect to the Emplyment Status, 
Second graph shows loan distribution against the employment duration in months.

# Design 
Yet there is no design change as yet no feedback received .

Hi +Vijay Barai .  As Feedback, I would suggest not using the circles and 
cleaning up the x-axis in the Employment Status Duration graph.  There is color intensity 
changing in the circles and I'm not sure what that is representing.  So it seems like a distraction 
from the overall graph. I would also suggest some titles to the graphs so I as the reader 
can know what should I focus my attention on. The first graph looks nice, but the axis 
titles could be a bit more descriptive (i.e. is the y-axis represented in Dollars?).  
The medium palette colors in the first graph is nice.  Very easy on the eyes.  Hope this helps!

Suyog Karnawat (Colleage):-
Over all graph looks good. In the second Graph x-axis values a too close to read.

Sagar Barbate (Colleage):-
There are some missing values in the data which giving a false interpretation of data.
I think you should remove them before plotting it.

# Resources 
From the given dataset I used "Intermediate-Loan Data from Prosper" data for my visualisation.
