# Summary 
My visualization is for a loan data. There are 2 graphs, one shows the loan distribution among a different state with respect to the Emplyment Status, 
Second graph shows loan distribution against the employment duration in months.
In the GitHub sample data the clear pattern may not appear but locally run code on the full data showing following findinngs:
1) First Gragh clealy show that CA (California) is a leading state for taking a Loan.
2) First graph also shows most of the loan taken by Employeed people.
3) Second graph shows that please with the less experiance or who just started the employment are taking a more loan compare to the 
   other people.

Hi +Vijay Barai .  As Feedback, I would suggest not using the circles and 
cleaning up the x-axis in the Employment Status Duration graph.  There is color intensity 
changing in the circles and I'm not sure what that is representing.  So it seems like a distraction 
from the overall graph. I would also suggest some titles to the graphs so I as the reader 
can know what should I focus my attention on. The first graph looks nice, but the axis 
titles could be a bit more descriptive (i.e. is the y-axis represented in Dollars?).  
The medium palette colors in the first graph is nice.  Very easy on the eyes.  Hope this helps!

Suyog Karnawat (Colleage):-
Over all graph looks good. In the second Graph x-axis values a too close to read.

Sagar Barbate (Colleage):-
There are some missing values in the data which giving a false interpretation of data.
I think you should remove them before plotting it.
